QUAKE FOOTBAWL

This mod changes CTF for quake 4 and makes it football.A rocketlauncher is spawned in the middle of the map and that acts as 
the football. When the ball is picked up the player is slowed for 10 seconds. When a player shoots a wall or floor, 
it spawns a rocketlauncher at that point. Each rocketlauncher only has one ammo. When a player is hit with the projectile 
he is automatically equipped with that rocketlauncher and that serves as passing. In order to score, you need to take the 
rocketlauncher to the enemies side and step over their flag. Note: you can only score with the rocketlauncher equipped as
your current weapon. Upon touchdown the player is blown up and the rocketlauncher is dropped. The scoring team gains 1 point. 
5 points win the game.Also the gauntlet that every player is equipped with knocks back players who are hit. 
It takes 3 hits to kill an enemy.
